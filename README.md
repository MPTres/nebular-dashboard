# Nebular Dashboard

This project wish to be an alternative to the official and now older Nebular Starter Kit.
It has been designed to works with the last - nebular supported - angular version (19), the last nebular packages (15) and customized with few essential (for me) packages:

-  ng-bootstrap
-  ngx-translate
-  secure-web-storage
-  @ngrx/store

## Live Demo

Live demo is avaialable at https://nebular.progel.net

## Node Version server

This project is tested to work with Node 22.10.0 64bit in Windows enviroment, but maybe can works also with other settings.
